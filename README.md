Install Windows 11 on unsupported machines.\
The idea behind this simple batch script is to allow the installation of Windows 11 operating system on unsupported machines due to its requirements and making it easier and more simple, than doing it manually (adding the registry keys one-by-one).\
Not only that, but by using this script, it's much safer than using a "homebrewed patched" ISO that are floating around on the internet.

# How to use
1. Download the script and place it anywhere you like.
2. On the installation screen, hit SHIFT + F10 to bring up the Command Prompt / CMD window.
3. Open the script on that CMD.
4. If there's no error, you can close the CMD.
5. Go back to previous back and then go to the next page to proceed.\
The "Unsupported" screen should no longer appear and you can continue the installation.

# Disclaimer
This script does **NOT** have the ability to allow user to enroll into the Windows 11 Insider program on an unsupported machine!.\
There are already people doing that and you can find such projects here on Github.
